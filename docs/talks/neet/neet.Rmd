<div class="notes">
Now we consider what we want to test in the context of data analysis
</div>


## testing the good | testing the good, the bad, and the ugly

<div class="notes">
Test for good inputs. Log expects a positive number.
</div>


```{r}
# test for fixed positive number
log(3)

# test for random positive number
x <- rexp(1)

# the exponential distribution only produces positive numbers

log(x)

```


## testing the bad| testing the good, the bad, and the ugly {.smaller}

<div class="notes">
Test for bad inputs. What if there's a numeric input, so expected type, but it's negative, so log doesn't work?
</div>


```{r}
# test for fixed negative number
log(-3)

# test for random netgative number
x <- -rexp(1)

# the exponential distribution only produces positive numbers

log(x)

```

## testing the ugly | testing the good, the bad, and the ugly

<div class="notes">
What about a non-numeric input, which is nonsense. We want it to fail & give informative errors.
</div>


```{r error = TRUE}
# test for ugly string input
log("pig")

# test for random string input
x <- c("cat", "pig", "bird") %>% sample(1)

log(x)

```

## test-driven development | balancing development with a measure of code::proof

todo: poster for the good the bad and the ugly

A **neet test** checks the function outputs a **non-empty** thing of **expected type**

# neet tests | a measure of sanity in building a data analysis

## neet test workflow

### set up

1. make a function
2. check in console it outputs a non-empty thing of expected type
3. convert this check into a test 
4. run test

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_testthat()


```
